To create this, I used two prompts in Bolt. The first prompt described that I wanted to create a Mancala game with a cute aesthetic and specified that there should be a computer opponent. After testing the output and seeing that the basic functionality worked, the second prompt asked to tweak some of the visual features of the game, specifically removing numbering from the pits and adding an animation to denote where the stones are currently being placed. I did not encounter any issues, and it took me one hour.
